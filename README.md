# Django Girls Taipei

Supplemental materials for Django Girls Taipei events. Used with [DjangoGirls.org/taipei](http://djangogirls.org/taipei). :)

Currently this is little more than a Markdown static page-serving app. We plan to add more things in the future.


## Write a doc

TODO: Put instructions on how to add a new Markdown document here.
